# CoSSAC: Python Turtle Drawing
*CoSSAC end of semester recursive art activity*

# Intro
This is a recursive drawing program in Python using turtle graphics. Some rules:
- No Python packages outside of the `stdlib`
- Should be done purely with `turtle` and not `tk` or any other graphics library

The documentation for `turtle` can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).
